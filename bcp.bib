% Conventions: 
%    * Common conferences (POPL, ICFP, etc.) are defined in strings, for
%      uniformity.  These strings include...
%         *not* "proceedings of the" or whatever (waste of ink, since
%            'symposium' or whatever is included)
%         the sponsoring organization (which means that it's not
%            necessary to list "ACM Press" as the publisher)
%         "international symposium" or whatever
%         *not* "twentieth" or whatever
%         the conference name spelled out in full
%         its common acronym, if any
%         the location of that year's meeting, if I know it

% Some special fields:
%     checked     Set to "yes" or a date if the citation has been
%                 checked against a physical copy of the document
%     fullauthor  Present in some cases where the author's name appears in
%                 abbreviated form on the actual document, but where
%                 I happened to know their full name.  The portion of
%                 the name that does not appear on the document is
%                 placed in square brackets, following standard
%                 practice in some publishing houses.

                  attractive object of theoretical study and a clean basis
                  for concurrent language design and implementation. However,
                  such generality has a cost: encoding higher-level features
                  like functional computation in pi-calculus throws away
                  potentially useful information. We show how a linear type
                  system can be used to recover important static information
                  about a process's behavior. In particular, we can guarantee
                  that two processes communicating over a linear channel
                  cannot interfere with other communicating processes. After
                  developing standard results such as soundness of typing, we
                  focus on equivalences, adapting the standard notion of
                  barbed bisimulation to the linear setting and showing how
                  reductions on linear channels induce a useful ``partial
                  confluence'' of process behaviors. For an extended example
                  of the theory, we prove the validity of a tail-call
                  optimization for higher-order functions represented as
                  processes.",

abstract     =   {How close are we to a world where every paper on
                  programming languages is accompanied by an electronic
                  appendix with machine-checked proofs?
                  
                  We propose a concrete set of benchmarks for measuring
                  progress in this area. Based on the metatheory of System
                  F-sub, a typed lambda-calculus with second-order
                  polymorphism, subtyping, and records, these benchmarks
                  embody many aspects of programming languages that are
                  challenging to formalize: variable binding at both the term
                  and type levels, syntactic forms with variable numbers of
                  components (including binders), and proofs demanding
                  complex induction principles. We hope that these benchmarks
                  will help clarify the current state of the art, provide a
                  basis for comparing competing technologies, and motivate
                  further research.}

                  {\textquoteleft}The science of deep
                  specification{\textquoteright} to work out the key
                  formal underpinnings of industrial-scale formal
                  specifications of software and hardware components,
                  anticipating a world where large verified systems
                  are routinely built out of smaller verified
                  components that are also used by many other
                  projects. We identify an important class of
                  specification that has already been used in a few
                  experiments that connect strong
                  component-correctness theorems across the work of
                  different teams. To help popularize the unique
                  advantages of that style, we dub it deep
                  specification, and we say that it encompasses
                  specifications that are rich, two-sided, formal and
                  live (terms that we define in the article). Our core
                  team is developing a proof-of-concept system (based
                  on the Coq proof assistant) whose specification and
                  verification work is divided across largely
                  decoupled subteams at our four institutions,
                  encompassing hardware microarchitecture, compilers,
                  operating systems and applications, along with
                  cross-cutting principles and tools for effective
                  specification. We also aim to catalyse interest in
                  the approach, not just by basic researchers but also
                  by users in industry. This article is part of the

  abstract =     "Region-based memory management is an attractive
                 alternative to garbage collection. It relies on a
                 compile-time analysis to annotate the program with
                 explicit allocation and deallocation instructions,
                 where lifetimes of memory objects are grouped together
                 in \emph{regions}. This paper investigates how to adapt
                 the runtime part of region-based memory management to
                 the WAM setting. We present additions to the memory
                 architecture and instruction set of the WAM that are
                 necessary to implement regions. We extend an optimized
                 WAM-based Prolog implementation with a region-based
                 memory manager which supports backtracking with instant
                 reclamation, and cuts. The performance of region-based
                 execution is compared with that of the baseline
                 garbage-collected implementation on several benchmark
                 programs. A region-enabled WAM performs competitively
                 and often results in time and/or space improvements.",

  summary =      "This thesis investigates whether region-based memory
                  management can succesfully be applied to Prolog
                  programs. The answer is affirmative. \\
                  It is shown how region-based memory management can be
                  extended to work with backtracking and logical
                  variables. Experiments with a prototype region-based
                  Prolog implementation show that the time efficiency of
                  the extended region-based model compares favorably with
                  garbage collection and is not prohibitively worse than
                  a purely stack-based Prolog implementation. \\
                  The thesis also describes a method for translating a
                  subset of Prolog into C programs that use the extended
                  region-based memory manager. The translation involves
                  several typed and untyped intermediate languages with
                  rigorously defined semantics. Informal arguments for
                  the correctness of most of the individual
                  transformation phases are provided; they are meant to
                  be expandable into fully rigorous proofs.",

                  inheritance. The extensions proposed are in keeping with
                  the spirit of the Scheme language and consequently differ
                  from Lisp-based object systems such as Flavours and the
                  Common Lisp Object System. Our extensions mesh neatly with
                  the underling Scheme system. We motivate our design with
                  examples, and then describe implementation techniques that
                  yields efficiency comparable to dynamic object-oriented
                  language implementations considered to be high performance.
                  The complete design has an almost-portable implementation,
                  and the core of this design comprises the object system
                  used in T, a dialect of Scheme. The applicative bias of our
                  approach is unusual in object-oriented programming
                  systems.",

                  abstraction via closures which accept a symbol and use that

                  approach to make it deal with inheritance/delegation.

                  of services and service features. Telecommunications
                  service providers are eager to offer new services on this
                  infrastructure, but the development of these new services
                  is hampered by interactions of the service features among
                  the different services. Undetected and undesirable feature
                  interactions cause confusion and dissatisfaction among the
                  users of services and add delay and expense to the
                  development and deployment of new services. This panel
                  reviews the progress that has been made in anticipating and
                  controlling undesirable feature interactions in
                  telecommunications services. This paper sets the stage by

                  the different phases of the software development

                  rewriting with cycles. The usual notion of homomorphism is
                  phrased in terms of the notion of bisimulation, which is
                  well-known in process algebra and concurrency theory.
                  Specifically, a homomorphism is a functional bisimulation.
                  We prove that the bisimilarity class of a term graph,
                  partially ordered by functional bisimulation, is a complete
                  lattice. It is shown how Equational Logic induces a notion
                  of copying and substitution on term graphs, or systems of
                  recursion equations, and also suggests the introduction of
                  hidden or nameless nodes in a term graph. Hidden nodes can
                  be used only once. The general framework of term graphs
                  with copying is compared with the more restricted copying
                  facilities embodied in the \$\mu\$-rule, and translations
                  are given between term graphs and \$\mu\$-expressions.
                  Using these, a proof system is given for
                  \$\mu\$-expressions that is complete for the semantics
                  given by infinite tree unwinding. Next, orthogonal term
                  graph rewrite systems, also in the presence of copying and
                  hidden nodes, are shown to be confluent."

                  multi-user applications. Applications are created by
                  designing the interface with a GUI-builder and embedding
                  callback code in an interpreted language, in much the same
                  way as one would build a traditional (non-distributed,
                  single-user) application with a modern user interface
                  development environment. The resulting application can be
                  run from within the GUI-builder for rapid turnaround or as
                  a stand-alone executable. The Visual Obliq runtime provides
                  abstractions and support for issues specific to distributed
                  computing, such as replication, sharing, communication, and
                  session management. We believe that the abstractions
                  provided, the simplicity of the programming model, the
                  rapid turnaround time, and the applicability to
                  heterogeneous environments, make Visual Obliq a viable tool
                  for authoring distributed applications and groupware."

                  motivated by coinductive characterizations of type

                  bisimulation, respectively. The main novelty of the
                  axiomatization is the fixpoint rule (or coinduction

                  operational interpretation of proofs as coercions and to

abstract =        "This paper discusses the technique of structural induction
                  for proving theorems about programs. This technique is
                  closely related to recursion induction but makes use of the
                  inductive definition of data structures handled by
                  programs. It treats programs with recursion but without
                  assignments or jumps. Some syntactic extensions to Landin's
                  functional programming language ISWIM are suggested which
                  make it easier to program the manipulation of data
                  structures and to develop proofs about such programs. Two
                  sample proofs are given to demonstrate the technique, one
                  for a tree sorting algorithm and one for a simple compiler
                  for expressions.",

                  support rapid construction of high-quality, extensible
                  software. Cecil combines multi-methods with a classless
                  object model, object-based encapsulation, and optional
                  static type checking. Cecil's static type system
                  distinguishes between subtyping and code inheritance, but
                  Cecil enables these two graphs to be described with a
                  single set of declarations, optimizing the common case
                  where the two graphs are parallel. Cecil includes a fairly
                  flexible form of parameterization, including both
                  explicitly parameterized objects, types, and methods and
                  implicitly parameterized methods related to the polymorphic
                  functions commonly found in functional languages. By making
                  type declarations optional, Cecil aims to support mixed
                  exploratory and production programming styles. This
                  document describes the design of the Cecil language as of
                  March, 1993. It mixes the specification of the language
                  with discussions of design issues and explanations of the
                  reasoning that led to various design decisions."

                  have been proposed but the complementary problem of data
                  conversion has been less studied. The YAT system provides a
                  means to build software components based on data
                  conversion, such as wrappers or mediators, in a simple and
                  declarative way. We show that the YAT system can also be
                  used to create integrated Web views over heterogeneous data
                  sources very easily. Only minor changes were required for
                  YAT to provide data integration (as opposed to data
                  conversion) in a Web environment. Finaly, we report on our
                  experience while building the Verso Web site using YAT."

abstract =        "Constraint-based program analyses are appealing because
                  elaborate analyses can be described with a concise and
                  simple set of constraint generation rules. Constraint
                  resolution algorithms have been developed for many kinds of
                  constraints, conceptually allowing an implementation of a
                  constraint-based program analysis to reuse large pieces of
                  existing code. In practice, however, new analyses often
                  involve re-implementing new, complex constraint solving
                  frameworks, tuned for the particular analysis in question.
                  This approach wastes development time and interferes with
                  the desire to experiment quickly with a number of different
                  analyses. <p> We believe that implementing an analysis
                  should require writing only the code to generate the
                  constraints, and that a well engineered-library can take
                  care of constraint representation, resolution, and
                  transformation. Writing such a library capable of handling
                  small programs is not too difficult, but scaling to large
                  programs is hard. Toward this goal, we are developing a
                  scalable, expressive framework for solving a class of set
                  constraints. Scalability is achieved through four
                  techniques: polymorphism, simplification, separation, and
                  sparse representation of constraints."

                  symbolic and scientific computations. Unlike previous
                  languages, FX uses an effect system to discover expression
                  scheduling constraints. The effect system is part of a
                  kinded type system with three base kinds: types, which
                  describe the value of an expression: effects, which
                  describe the side-effects that an expression may have; and
                  regions, which describe the areas of the store in which
                  side-effects may occur. Types, effects, and regions are
                  collectively descriptions. FX expressions can be abstracted
                  over any kind of description. This permits type, effect,
                  and region polymorphism. Unobservable side-effects are
                  masked by the effect system; an effect soundness property
                  guarantees that the effects computed statically by the
                  effect system are a conservative approximation of the
                  actual side-effects that a given expression may have.
                  Effect polymorphism and effect masking make the FX effect
                  system substantially more powerful than previous approaches
                  to side-effect analysis."

                  resolving overloading introduced by type classes, as used
                  in the functional programming language Haskell. Programs
                  including type classes are transformed into ones which may
                  be typed by standard Hindley-Milner inference rules. In
                  contrast to other work on type classes, the rules presented
                  here relate directly to Haskell programs. An innovative
                  aspect of this work is the use of second-order lambda
                  calculus to record type information in the transformed
                  program."

                  underlying the type system for ML and several other
                  strongly typed polymorphic functional languages such as
                  Miranda and Haskell. Mycroft (1984) has extended its
                  problematic monomorphic typing rule for recursive
                  definitions with a polymorphic typing rule. He proved the
                  resulting type system, which the Milner-Mycroft calculus,
                  sound with respect to Milner's semantics, and showed that
                  it preserves the principal typing property of the
                  Damas-Milner calculus. The extension is of practical
                  significance in typed logic programming languages and, more
                  generally, in any language with (mutually) recursive
                  definitions. The author shows that the type inference
                  problem for the Milner-Mycroft calculus is log-space
                  equivalent to semiunification, the problem of solving
                  subsumption inequations between first-order terms. In
                  connection with the recently established undecidability of
                  semiunification this implies that typability in the
                  Milner-Mycroft calculus is undecidable. He presents some
                  reasons why type inference with polymorphic recursion
                  appears to be practical despite its undecidability. This
                  also sheds some light on the observed practicality of ML in
                  the face of recent theoretical intractability results.
                  Finally, he exhibits a semiunification algorithm upon which
                  a flexible, practical, and implementable type inference
                  algorithm for both Damas-Milner and Milner-Mycroft typing
                  can be based."

abstract =        "Standard ML of New Jersey (SML-NJ) uses ``weak type
                  variables'' to restrict the polymorphic use of functions
                  that may allocate reference cells, manipulate
                  continuations, or use exceptions. However, the type system
                  used in the SML-NJ compiler has not been presented in a
                  form other than source code and has not been proved
                  correct. We present a type system, in the form of typing
                  rules and an equivalent algorithm, that appears to subsume
                  the implemented algorithm. Both use type variables of only
                  a slightly more general nature than the compiler. One
                  insight in the analysis is that the indexed type of a free
                  variable is used in two ways, once in describing the
                  applicative behavior of the variable itself, and once in
                  describing the larger term containing the variable. Taking
                  this into account, we formulate an application rule that is
                  more general than SML-NJ for applications of polymorphic
                  functions to imperative arguments. The soundness of the
                  type system is proved for imperative code using operational
                  semantics, by a technique that involves equivalence classes
                  of related type variables."

                  with type systems based on implicit parametric polymorphism
                  generally destroys the principal type property: namely that
                  the type of every expression can uniformly be represented
                  by a single type expression over some set of type
                  variables. As a consequence, type inference in the presence
                  of unrestricted overloading can become a NP-complete
                  problem. In ths paper we define the concept of parametric
                  overloading as a restricted form of overloading which is
                  easily combined with parametric polymorphism. Parametric
                  overloading preserves the principal type property, thereby
                  allowing the design of efficient type inference algorithms.
                  We present sound type deduction systems, both for
                  predefiend and programmer defined overloading. Finally we
                  state that parametric overloading can be resolved either
                  statically, at compile time, or dynamically, during program
                  execution."

                  unification-based type inference in a nonstandard type
                  system, using rows to approximate both the flow of escaping
                  exceptions (a la effect systems) and the flow of result
                  values (a la control-flow analyses). The resulting analysis
                  is efficient and precise; in particular, arguments carried
                  by exceptions are accurately handled."

                  definitions and type declarations are analyzed in detail.
                  Church's -calculus is used as a model of a programming
                  language for purposes of the analysis. The main result on
                  recursion is an analogue to Kleene's first recursion
                  theorem: If A = FA for any -expressions A and F, then A is
                  an extension of YF in the sense that if E(YF), any
                  expression containing YF, has a normal form then E(YF) =
                  E(A). Y is Curry's paradoxical combinator. The result is
                  shown to be invariant for many different versions of Y. A
                  system of types and type declarations is developed for the
                  I-calculus and its semantic assumptions are identified. The
                  system is shown to be adequate in the sense that it permits
                  a preprocessor to check formulae prior to evaluation to
                  prevent type errors. It is shown that any formula with a
                  valid assignment of types to all its subexpressions must
                  have a normal form.",

                  distinctions to be made, allow despatching to be avoided in
                  some cases, and may be used to avoid some restrictions of
                  the contravariance rule. Once multivariant functions are
                  introduced by example, the semantics of the despatch of
                  multivariants are provided, based on the generation of
                  despatching variants. Three issues arise with despatching:
                  redundancy, ambiguity, and exhaustiveness of a
                  (partially-oredered) set of variants with respect to a

                  abstraction violations, find unused variables, functions,
                  and fields of data structures, detect simple errors in
                  operations on abstract datatypes, and locate sites of
                  possible references to a value. We compute representation
                  sharing with type inference, using types to encode
                  representations. The method is efficient, fully automatic,
                  and smoothly integrates pointer aliasing and higher-order
                  functions. We show how we used a prototype tool to answer a
                  user's questions about a 17,000 line program written in C."

                  with additional constructs and reduction rules that
                  represent mutable variables and assignments. The extended
                  calculus has neither a concept of an explicit store nor a
                  concept of evaluation order; nevertheless, the authors show
                  that programs in the calculus can be implemented using a
                  single-threaded store. They also show that the new calculus
                  has the Church-Rosser property and that it is a
                  conservative extension of classical lambda calculus with
                  respect to operational equivalence; that is, all algebraic
                  laws of the functional subset are preserved."

                  problem of reasoning about properties of higher order
                  functions involving state. It is motivated by the desire to
                  identify what, if any, are the difficulties created purely
                  by {\em locality\/} of state, independent of other
                  properties such as side-effects, exceptional termination
                  and non-termination due to recursion. We consider a simple
                  language (equivalent to a fragment of Standard ML) of
                  typed, higher order functions that can dynamically create
                  fresh {\em names\/}; names are created with local scope,
                  can be tested for equality and can be passed around via
                  function application, but that is all. Despite the extreme
                  simplicity of the language and its operational semantics,
                  the observable properties of such functions are shown to be
                  very subtle. A notion of `logical relation' is introduced
                  which incorporates a version of {\em representation
                  independence\/} for local names. We show how to use it to
                  establish observational equivalences. The method is shown
                  to be complete (and decidable) for expressions of first
                  order types, but incomplete at higher types.}

abstract =        { The FLINT project at Yale aims to build a
                  state-of-the-art systems environment for modern typesafe
                  languages. One important component of the FLINT system is a
                  high-performance type-directed compiler for SML'97
                  (extended with higher-order modules). The FLINT/ML compiler
                  provides several new capabilities that are not available in
                  other type-based compilers: type-directed compilation is
                  carried over across the higher-order module boundaries;
                  recursive and mutable data objects can use unboxed
                  representations without incurring expensive runtime cost on
                  heavily polymorphic code; parameterized modules (functors)
                  can be selectively specialized, just as normal polymorphic
                  functions; new type representations are used to reduce the
                  cost of type manipulation thus the compilation time. This
                  paper gives an overview of these novel aspects, and a
                  preliminary report on the current status of the
                  implementation. }

                  distance from their source. Although polymorphic
                  type-checking systems like those in ML help greatly by
                  detecting potential run-time type errors at compile-time,
                  such systems are still not very helpful for locating the
                  source of a type error. Typically, an error is reported
                  only when the type-checker can proceed no further, even
                  though the programmer's actual error may have occurred much
                  earlier in the text. We describe an algorithm which appears
                  to be quite helpful in isolating and explaining the source
                  of type errors. The algorithm works by keeping track of the
                  reasons the checker makes deductions about the types of

                  checking that accommodates both dynamic typing and static
                  typing in one framework. A soft type checker infers types
                  for identifiers and inserts explicit run-time checks to
                  transform untypable programs to typable form. {\em Soft
                  Scheme} is a practical soft type system for R4RS Scheme.
                  The type checker uses a representation for types that is
                  expressive, easy to interpret, and supports efficient type
                  inference. Soft Scheme supports all of R4RS Scheme,
                  including uncurried procedures of fixed and variable arity,
                  assignment, and continuations."

                  language, which prevent them from handling certain
                  important compiler optimizations such as run-time array
                  bound check elimination. We also mention a compiler which

                 Research Internet. It provides facilities for the
                 delivery of digital messages such as computer mail; for
                 naming people, machines, and services; for
                 authenticating people and machines; and for locating
                 services on the internet. This paper has two goals: to
                 describe the system itself and to serve as a case study
                 of a real application of distributed computing. Part I
                 describes the set of services provided by Grapevine and
                 how its data and function are divided among computers
                 on the internet. Part II presents in more detail
                 selected aspects of Grapevine that illustrate novel
                 facilities or implementation techniques, or that
                 provide insight into the structure of a distributed
                 system. Part III summarizes the current state of the
                 system and the lessons learned from it so far.",

  OLDabstract =     "We have developed a compiler for the lexically-scoped
                 dialect of LISP known as SCHEME. The compiler knows
                 relatively little about specific data manipulation
                 primitives such as arithmetic operators, but
                 concentrates on general issues of environment and
                 control. Rather than having specialized knowledge about
                 a large variety of control and environment constructs,
                 the compiler handles only a small basis set which
                 reflects the semantics of lambda- calculus. All of the
                 traditional imperative constructs, such as sequencing,
                 assignment, looping, GOTO, as well as many standard
                 LISP constructs such as AND, OR, and COND, are
                 expressed in macros in terms of the applicative basis
                 set. A small number of optimization techniques, coupled
                 with the treatment of function calls as GOTO
                 statements, serve to produce code as good as that
                 produced by more traditional compilers. The macro
                 approach enables speedy implementation of new
                 constructs as desired without sacrificing efficiency in
                 the generated code. A fair amount of analysis is
                 devoted to determining whether environments may be
                 stack-allocated or must be heap- allocated.
                 Heap-allocated environments are necessary in general
                 because SCHEME (unlike Algol 60 and Algol 68, for
                 example) allows procedures with free lexically scoped
                 variables to be returned as the values of other
                 procedures; the Algol stack-allocation environment
                 strategy does not suffice. The methods used here
                 indicate that a heap- allocating generalization of the
                 {"}display{"} technique leads to an efficient
                 implementation of such {"}upward funargs{"}. Moreover,
                 compile- time optimization and analysis can eliminate
                 many {"}funargs{"} entirely, and so far fewer
                 environment structures need be allocated at run time
                 than might be expected. A subset of SCHEME (rather than
                 triples, for example) serves as the representation
                 intermediate between the optimized SCHEME code and the
                 final output code; code is expressed in this subset in
                 the so-called continuation-passing style. As a subset
                 of SCHEME, it enjoys the same theoretical properties;
                 one could even apply the same optimizer used on the
                 input code to the intermediate code. However, the
                 subset is so chosen that all temporary quantities are
                 made manifest as variables, and no control stack is
                 needed to evaluate it. As a result, this apparently
                 applicative representation admits an imperative
                 interpretation which permits easy transcription to
                 final imperative machine code. These qualities suggest
                 that an applicative language like SCHEME is a better
                 candidate for an UNCOL than the more imperative
                 candidates proposed to date.",

  abstract =	"Cooperation between independent agents depends upon
		 establishing adegree of security. Each of the
		 cooperating agents needs assurance that the cooperation
		 will not endanger resources of value to that agent. In
		 a computer system, a computational mechanism can assure
		 safe cooperation among the system's users by mediating
		 resource access according to desired security policy.
		 Such a mechanism, which is called a security kernel,
		 lies at the heart of many operating systems and
		 programming environments.The report describes Scheme
		 48, a programming environment whose design is guided by
		 established principles of operating system security.
		 Scheme 48's security kernel is small, consisting of the
		 call-by-value $lambda$-calculus with a few simple
		 extensions to support abstract data types, object
		 mutation, and access to hardware resources. Each agent
		 (user or subsystem) has a separate evaluation
		 environment that holds objects representing privileges
		 granted to that agent. Because environments ultimately
		 determine availability of object references, protection
		 and sharing can be controlled largely by the way in
		 which environments are constructed. I will describe
		 experience with Scheme 48 that shows how it serves as a
		 robust and flexible experimental platform. Two
		 successful applications of Scheme 48 are the
		 programming environment for the Cornell mobile robots,
		 where Scheme 48 runs with no (other) operating system
		 support; and a secure multi-user environment that runs
		 on workstations.",
