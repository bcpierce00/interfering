\section{Threat Model, Machines, and Enforcement }

Before introducing our formal model of stack safety, we describe
our machine exemplar, enforcement mechanism, and threat model.

We begin with a RISC-V-like machine enhanced with PIPE, a tag-based reference
monitory. We extend this machine with a {\it security overlay semantics}:
a semantics in which calls, returns, and other operations of interest are condensed
into atomic {\it macro-instructions}, which update an additional security context.
As opposed to a fully-abstract overlay semantics, in which the semantics is safe
by construction and compilation to an enforcement mechanism must be proved fully abstract,
our machine's semantics are not safe unless the tag policy is correctly
instantiated, but the security context informs trace properties that
must hold under a policy for that policy to be considered valid.

The underlying machine is a standard RISC-V ISA as modeled in [MIT-RISCV].
Our overlay semantics provide macro-instructions for the following code features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Function calls and returns, with caller- and callee-saved registers according
  to the RISC-V ABI
\item Arguments passed by reference
\item Exceptions
\item Coroutines and cooperative threading
\item Tail-call Elimination
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{What is a ``call''?} Some ISAs have a single ``call''
instruction that does all the required manipulation of the program counter
(\(\PCname\)) and stack pointer; others perform a series of instructions
whose constituent opcodes may be used in some places for other purposes.
Our RISC-V machine is the latter, so calls must be explicitly designated
as such by the compiler, by identifying them as macro-instructions.
The same goes for other operations, such as exceptions and coroutine yields.
Macro-instructions connect the enforcement mechanism to the property: we don't
expect the enforcement mechanism to provide any guarantees for code sequences
that resemble calls or returns, but which are not macro-instructions.

Because macro-instructions must be generated by the compiler, they only
carry data that can be known by the compiler at compile-time. For example,
the \(\mathbf{call}\) macro-instruction identifies the register \(r\) containing
the address of the function to be called, as well as a {\it type record} identifying
the registers and addresses in which the callee expects to find arguments,
and a {\it public set}.
Let \(tr \in TR\) be a type record; then \(tr.args\) is a set of those registers
that will be used for arguments, and \(tr.stack\_args\) defines a set of
offsets from the stack pointer that are expected to contain additional
arguments.The public set \(pubs\) defines a similar set of offsets in
the caller that are declared public and not to be protected.

%\paragraph*{Enforcement Model and Properties}

%A machine state consists of the standard addresses and registers, as well as
%additional policy state used by the enforcement mechanism. Our properties
%refer only to addresses and registers; they do not constrain the behavior
%of policy state. We model an execution step as a partial function on states:
%when the machine does not step from a given state, this
%is a {\em failstop}, halting the program before it can perform an
%action that would violate the security property.
%our properties are therefore naturally \emph{termination insensitive.}

\paragraph*{Threat Model}

We trust the compiler has correctly placed macro-instructions according to
the semantics of the source language, but we do not assume that the code
is otherwise reasonable. In particular, while we are agnostic as to the source
language, C is very plausible, and so any source function might contain undefined
behavior resulting in its compilation to arbitrary machine code.

In general, it is impossible to distinguish buggy source code from an attacker;
we assume nothing about the intent of the source code, except that it makes calls
and returns, and guarantee that the caller and callee are protected from one
another.

This is a strong threat model, but hardware and timing attacks are out of scope,
and our properties are termination insensitive as a result of the enforcement mechanism
(below).

\paragraph*{Limitations}

We do not support dynamic code generation or concurrency---we can handle a
limited form of coroutines, but not full-blown preemptive concurrency.
[Say something about Heap Safety]

\subsection{The Machine in Detail}
\label{sec:prelim}

The building blocks of the machine are {\em words} and {\em registers}.
Words are 64-bit integers ranged over by \(w\) and, when used as addresses,
\(a\). Each processor has 32 registers, ranged over in general by \(r\),
plus a program counter (\(\PCname\)). The following table divides
the registers into metavariables, some belonging to caller- or callee- sets:

\vspace{\abovedisplayskip}
\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
  \hline
  Set & Names & Purpose \\
  \hline
  CLR\_SV & \(rt_0 - rt_6\) & Caller-saved temps \\
  & \(ra_0 - ra_1\) & Caller-saved args / return vals \\
  & \(ra_2 - ra_7\) & Caller-saved args \\
  \hline
  CLE\_SV & \(rs_0 - rs_7\) & Callee-saved \\
  \hline
  PUBLIC & \(rra\) & Return Address \\
  & \(rsp\) & Stack Pointer \\
  & \(pc\) & Program Counter \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\vspace{\abovedisplayskip}

We specify that a register belongs to processor \(\rho \in \mathcal{R}\) by writing
it \(r^\rho\), but will omit this notation when the active
processor is unambiguous from context.

Collectively addresses and registers are {\em state elements} \(\component\)
in the set \(\COMPONENTS ::= \WORDS + \REGS\).
%
A {\em machine state} \(\mach \in \MACHS ::= \COMPONENTS \rightarrow \WORDS\)
is a mapping from state elements to values. For convenience, we abbreviate
multiple updates \(m[\component_0 \mapsto \word_0][\component_1 \mapsto \word_1]\dots\)
as \(m \llbracket A \mapsto B | C \rrbracket\), where \(A\) and \(B\)
are fomulae with free variables bound to sets in \(C\).
The base machine step relation 
\(\mach \harpoonunder{\rho}_M \mach' \subseteq \MACHS \times \mathcal{R} \times \MACHS\)
represents a single step of the processor \(\rho\).

The machine is equipped with additional state representing the tag-based hardware.
We represent this as a policy state, \(\pol \in \POLS ::= \COMPONENTS \rightarrow \mathcal{T}\),
where \(\mathcal{T}\) is the set of tags, discussed [in the section on security.]
We represent a {\it policy} via the step relation
\(\mach, \pol \harpoonunder{\rho}_P \pol' \subseteq \MACHS \times \POLS \times \mathcal{R} \times \POLS\).
Steps are deterministic and  undefined represents a {\it failstop}.

Separate from the machine state, we keep track of additional security context
information over the course of the run. This data is not relevant to execution,
it is only used to define the stack safety property. We define a set of
{\it security classes}:
\[sc \in SEC ::= \sealed | \mathit{object}(\phi) | \unsealed\]
And of {\it targets}, which identify the addresses of the program counter or
stack pointer at a return or catch point:
\[\begin{split}
tar \in TAR ::= & \mathit{Return} ~ a_{pc} ~ a_{sp} \\
| & \mathit{Catch} ~ a_{pc} ~ a_{sp} \\
\end{split}\]
A {\it security view} \(V \in \mathit{VIEW} ::= \COMPONENTS \rightarrow SEC\) divides the machine
elements in terms of their purpose relative to the active function.
And a {\it stack context} is a stack of pairs of targets and views:
\[\context \in \CONTEXTS ::= \mathit{list} ~ (\mathit{TAR} \times \mathit{VIEW})\]

Our properties additionally depend on a rudimentary model of memory-safe
objects and pointer provenance. A provenance \(\phi \in \mathbb{N}\)
identifies a value derived from the \(\phi\)th object allocated since
the beginning of execution. A provenance map
\(\prov \in \PROVS ::= \COMPONENTS \rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}}\)
designates, for every machine element, which provenances its current
value contains. We define a step relation on provenance maps
\(\mach, \prov \harpoonunder{\rho}_{pm} \prov' \subseteq \MACHS \times
\PROVS \times \mathcal{R} \times \PROVS\),
exerpted in Figure \ref{fig:provenance} [TODO].

The set of instructions, \(I \subseteq \WORDS\), corresponds to the RISC-V ISA.
We further introduce {\it overlay sequences}: sequences of
instructions that operate as if they were single, atomic pseudoinstructions.
An overlay sequence consists of both a list
of instructions and a pseudoinstruction that identifies its purpose in the
property. The pseudoinstructions, and the data that they carry, are as follows.
[TODO: still handle stack args by offset.]

\begin{align*}
\psi \in \Psi ::= & \mathbf{call} ~ \reg_{target} ~ \overline{\reg_{args}} & \\
| & \mathbf{tailcall} ~ \reg_{target} ~ \overline{\reg_{args}} & \\
| & \mathbf{return} & \\
| & \mathbf{alloc} ~ size ~ public & size \in \mathbb{N}, public \in \mathbb{B} \\
| & \mathbf{setex} \\
| & \mathbf{throwex} \\
\end{align*}

An overlay sequence \(j \in J\) is a pair of a pseudoinstruction and
a non-empty list of instructions.

We define a step relation over triples of a machine state,
a policy state, and a provenance map:

\judgmentthree{\(\mach \harpoonunder{\rho}_M \mach'\)}
              {\(\mach, \pol \harpoonunder{\rho}_P \pol'\)}
              {\(\mach, \prov \harpoonunder{\rho}_{pm} \prov'\)}
              {\((\mach,\pol,\prov) \stepstounder{\rho} (\mach',\pol',\prov')\)}

And we define a {\it ranged-step} relation that, given a pair of addresses
\(a_{low}\) and \(a_{high}\), steps as long the program counter is between them.

\judgment[Done]
         {\(\mach[\PCname] < a_{low} \lor \mach[\PCname] > a_{high}\)}
         {\(a_{low},a_{high} \vdash (\mach,\pol,\prov) \manystepstounder{\rho} (\mach,\pol,\prov)\)}

\judgmenttwobrlong[Step]
                  {\(a_{low} \leq \mach[\PCname] < a_{high}\)}
                  {\((\mach,\pol,\prov) \stepstounder{\rho} (\mach',\pol',\prov')\)}
                  {\(a_{low},a_{high} \vdash (\mach',\pol',\prov') \manystepstounder{\rho} (\mach'',\pol'',\prov'')\)}
                  {\(a_{low},a_{high} \vdash (\mach,\pol,\prov) \manystepstounder{\rho} (\mach'',\pol'',\prov'')\)}

Now we're finally ready to introduce the overlay semantics.
A {\it full state} \(\sigma\) consists of a 4-tuple of a machine state,
a policy state, a provenance map, and a stack context:
\[\sigma = (\mach, \pol, \prov, ctxs) \in \mathcal{S} ::=
\MACHS \times \POLS \times \PROVS \times (\mathcal{R} \rightarrow \CONTEXTS)\]

The execution relation for full states
\(\sigma \stepstounder{\rho;\psi?} \sigma' \subseteq
\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{R} \times (\Psi + \bot) \times \mathcal{S}\)
proceeds by an {\it overlay step}
if the program counter points to the start of an overlay sequence.
Otherwise, it proceeds by the default step. The definitions of context steps
\(\harpoonunder{\rho;\psi}_C\) will be defined for each pseudoinstruction as we go.

\judgmenttwobrlongbrlong[Overlay]
                        {\(j = (\psi, \bar{i})\)}
                        {\(\mach',\prov',ctxs ~ \rho \harpoonunder{\rho;\psi}_C \context\)}
                        {\((\mach,\pol,\prov) \manystepstounder{\rho} (\mach',\pol',\prov')\)}
                        {\(\mach[\PCname+n] = \bar{i}[n]\) for each \(n\) where \(0 \leq n < |\bar{i}|\)}
                        {\((\mach,\pol,\prov,ctxs) \stepstounder{\rho;\psi} (\mach',\pol',\prov',ctxs[\rho \mapsto \context])\)}

\judgment[Default]
         {\((\mach,\pol,\prov) \stepstounder{\rho} (\mach',\pol',\prov')\)}
         {\((\mach,\pol,\prov,ctxs) \stepstounder{\rho; \bot} (\mach',\pol',\prov',ctxs)\)}

\paragraph*{Overlay sequence definitions}

[TBD]

Note that there can be multiple overlay sequences with different instructions
that represent the same pseudoinstruction.
[This is less likely when we have smaller pseudoinstructions.]

\paragraph*{Concurrency}

Thus far, we have defined the step relation of a single processor.
We model multiple processors able to step independently by a global step relation,
\(\stepstounder{}\), which simply steps an arbitrary processor:

\judgment[]
         {\(\sigma \stepstounder{\rho} \sigma'\)}
         {\(\sigma \stepstounder{} \sigma'\)}

\section{Stack Safety With Calls and Returns}

In this section we will present the context steps for allocations,
calls, and returns, and show how they
translate into properties. They are given formally in Figure \ref{fig:callcontexts}.
Allocations are simple: from the current stack pointer, a range up to the size of
the allocation is marked \(\mathit{object}(\phi)\) for a fresh identifier \(\phi\).

First, we define a function, {\it update view}, that defines the view of a callee
in terms of that of the callee, together with the provenance map.
First, all stack locations below the stack pointer
are \(\unsealed\) -- fair game for the callee to allocate or write to, and
to read after writing. Above the stack pointer, anything that is not an object
becomes \(\sealed\). Argument and system registers are automatically marked
\(\mathit{public}\), and all others are \(\sealed\).
Finally, we must address stack objects: we recursively identify all objects
that are reachable via pointer provenances found in \(\mathit{public}\)
registers and in reachable objects, and these retain their view, while
all others become \(\sealed\). [TODO: implement \(\mathit{reach}\) to do this.]

To update the context, we pair the updated view with the return target of the
call: the return target tells us whether a return is to the proper location
which the stack pointer restored, and the view tells us how to treat the
security of the callee's state. We define \(\mathit{hd\_def}\) as taking
a context and returning its head, or \(((0,0),\lambda \component.\unsealed)\)
if the context is empty. [TODO: structure it so that we don't need to return
  a dummy target.]

\begin{figure*}
\[\begin{split}
& \mathit{update\_view} ~ V ~ \prov ~ a_{sp} ~ \overline{r_{args}} \triangleq
\lambda \component .
\begin{cases}
  \mathit{public} & \textnormal{else if } \component \in \REGS \textnormal{ and }
  \component \in \overline{r_{args}} \textnormal{ or } \component \in \mathit{PUBLIC} \\
  \mathit{object}(\phi) & \textnormal{else if } (V ~ \component) = \mathit{object}(\phi)
  \textnormal{ and } \phi \in \mathit{reach} ~ \prov ~ V ~ \overline{r_{args}} \\
  \sealed & \textnormal{else if } \component \in \WORDS \textnormal{ and } a_{sp} < \component \leq a_{sbase} \\
  \unsealed & \textnormal{otherwise} \\
\end{cases} \\
\end{split}\]

\judgmenttwobrlong[CallC]
                  {\(\psi = \mathbf{call} ~ r_{target} ~ \overline{r_{args}}\)}
                  {\(\context' = (\mathit{Return} ~ (m[pc] + 4) ~ m[sp], V)::\context\)}
                  {\(V = \mathit{update\_view} ~ (snd ~ (hd\_def ~ \context)) ~ m[sp] ~ \overline{r_{args}}\)}
                  {\(\mach, \prov, \context \constep{\rho;\psi} \context'\)}

\judgment[ReturnCCons]
         {\(j = \mathbf{return}\)}
         {\(m, (\mathit{return} ~ a_{pc} ~ a_{sp}, V)::\context \constep{\rho;\psi} \context\)}

\judgment[ReturnCNil]
         {\(j = \mathbf{return}\)}
         {\(m, [] \constep{\rho;\psi} []\)}
           
\caption{Call, enter, and return macro-instructions}
\label{fig:callcontexts}
\end{figure*}

\section{Stack Safety, Formally}
\label{sec:properties}

Now we can give our definition of stack safety. Each overlay sequence defines a
context step; in turn, the context at the point of a call or return defines a
property each for integrity, confidentiality, and well-bracketed control flow.

\subsection{Facts Abouts Calls and Returns}

Here we define some logical operations to reason about the behavior of the
system over time. These have a temporal-logic flavor, as they reflect
the expected behavior of the system in the future, after a possible return.

\paragraph*{Event Traces}

Some steps of execution can be interpreted as {\it events} that can be observed
from outside the system. We define events \(\obs \in \OBSS\) as calls, labeled
with the target address and the values of the arguments, or else as the silent
event \(\tau\):
\[\begin{split}
\obs \in \OBSS ::= & ~ \mathbf{callE} ~ a_{target} ~ \overline{w_{args}} \\
| & ~ \tau \\
\end{split}\]

A {\em trace} is a nonempty, finite or infinite sequence
of pairs of processors and events, ranged over by \(\obsT\).
We use ``\(\notfinished{}{}\)'' to represent ``cons'' for traces, reserving ``::''
for list-cons.

We convert macro-instructions into events via the \(\mathit{observe}\)
function, observing the values of relevant registers, defined in Figure \ref{fig:observe}.

\begin{figure*}
\[\mathit{observe} ~ \rho ~ \psi? ~ m =
\begin{cases}
  (\rho, \mathbf{callE} ~ m[\PCname] ~ m \llbracket r | r \in \overline{r_{args}} \rrbracket)
  & \textnormal{when } ~ \psi = \mathbf{call} ~ r_{target} ~ \overline{r_{args}} \\
  (\rho, \mathbf{returnE} ~ m[\PCname] & \textnormal{when } \psi = \mathbf{return} \\
  (\rho, \tau) & \textnormal{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}\]
\caption{Converting overlay steps to events}
\label{fig:observe}
\end{figure*}

We write that execution from a state produces an observation trace \(\sigma \hookrightarrow \obsT\)
as follows, coinductively:

\judgment{\(\not \exists \sigma' . \sigma \stepstounder{} \sigma'\)}
         {\(\sigma \hookrightarrow \tau\)}

\judgmenttwo{\(\sigma \stepstounder{\rho; \psi?} \sigma'\)}
            {\(\sigma' \hookrightarrow \obsT\)}
            {\(\sigma \hookrightarrow \notfinished{(\mathit{observe} ~ \rho ~ \psi? (\pi_m{\sigma'}))}{\obsT}\)}

\paragraph*{Trace Until Return}

We define another relation that takes a trace of a callee up to its return, if one occurs.
We write this \(\context \downarrow \sigma \hookrightarrow \obsT\), where \(\context\)
is the context of the caller.

\judgment{\(\context = \pi_c(\sigma)\)}
         {\(\context \downarrow \sigma \hookrightarrow \tau\)}

\judgmentthree{\(\sigma \stepstounder{\rho,\psi?} \sigma'\)}
              {\(\context \not = \pi_c(\sigma')\)}
              {\(\context \downarrow \sigma' \hookrightarrow \obsT\)}
              {\(\context \downarrow \sigma \hookrightarrow \notfinished{(\mathit{observe} ~ \rho ~ \psi? (\pi_m{\sigma'}))}{\obsT}\)}


\paragraph*{Observational Similarity}

We say that two event traces $\obsT_1$ and $\obsT_2$ are {\em similar}
from the perspective of an external observer, written \(\obsT_1 \eqsim
\obsT_2\), if the sequence of non-silent events is the same. That is, we
compare up to deletion of \(\tau\) events, coinductively:

\begin{minipage}{.4\columnwidth}
  \judgment{}{\(\obsT \eqsim \obsT\)}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{.4\columnwidth}
  \judgment{\(\obsT_1 \eqsim \obsT_2\)}
           {\(\notfinished{\tau}{\obsT_1} \eqsim \obsT_2\)}
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{.4\columnwidth}
  \judgment{\(\obsT_1 \eqsim \obsT_2\)}
           {\(\obsT_1 \eqsim \notfinished{\tau}{\obsT_2}\)}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{.4\columnwidth}
  \judgment{\(\obsT_1 \eqsim \obsT_2\)}
           {\(\notfinished{\obs}{\obsT_1} \eqsim \notfinished{\obs}{\obsT_2}\)}
\end{minipage}

\paragraph*{On-return}

The intuition behind {\it return-time integrity} (below) is that a caller may expect its
sealed data to be unchanged when control returns to it. In fact, the callee
may overwrite such data -- when the data are found in callee-saved registers
this is perfectly legal -- as long as it either restores it, or has some guarantee
that its changes will impact the caller.

We start by defining a second-order logical operator
\(\context \uparrow P\), read ``\(P\) holds on return to \(\context\),''
where \(P\) is a predicate on machine states. This is a coinductive relation
similar to ``weak until'' in temporal logic -- it holds if the condition
is never reached.

\judgment{\(P ~ \mach\)}
         {\((\context \uparrow P) ~ (\mach, \pol, \prov, \context)\)}

\judgmenttwobrlong{\(\context_0 \not = \context\)}
                  {\((\context_0 \uparrow P) ~ (\mach', \pol', \prov', \context')\)}
                  {\((\mach, \pol, \prov, \context) \stepstounder{\rho,\psi?}
                    (\mach', \pol', \prov', \context')\)}
                  {\((\context_0 \uparrow P) ~ (\mach, \pol, \prov, \context)\)}

Similarly, in {\it caller confidentiality}, we will want to compare future states,
so we give a binary equivalent, \(\context \Uparrow R\), so that
\(\sigma (\context \Uparrow R) \sigma'\) holds if \(R\) holds on the
first return states of after \(\sigma\) and \(\sigma'\).

\judgment[Returned]
         {\(\mach ~ R ~ \mach'\)}
         {\((\mach,\pol,\prov,\context) ~ (\context \Uparrow R) ~ (\mach',\pol',\prov',\context)\)}

\judgmentthree[Left]
              {\(\context \not = \pi_c(\sigma_1)\)}
              {\(\sigma_1 \stepstounder{\rho;\psi?} \sigma_1'\)}
              {\(\sigma_1' ~ (\context \Uparrow R) ~ \sigma_2\)}     
              {\(\sigma_1 ~ (\context \Uparrow R) ~ \sigma_2\)}

\judgmentthree[Right]
              {\(\context \not = \pi_c(\sigma_2)\)}
              {\(\sigma_2 \stepstounder{\rho;\psi?} \sigma_2'\)}
              {\(\sigma_1 ~ (\context \Uparrow R) ~ \sigma_2'\)}     
              {\(\sigma_1 ~ (\context \Uparrow R) ~ \sigma_2\)}
              
\paragraph*{Variants and Safe Elements}

One or more elements of a given state are {\it safe} if their values
in that state have no observable influence on future execution. We define this
formally as a sort of non-interference: for a state \(\sigma\) and
a set of elements \(\components\), \(\mathit{safe} ~ \sigma ~ \components\)
holds if we can replace the contents of \(\components\) with arbitrary values
and have the resulting state produce an equivalent trace. The state created
by modifying \(\components\) in this way is termed a variant.

\definition Machine states \(\mach\) and \(\nach\) are {\em \(\components\)-variants},
written \(\mach \approx_\components \nach\), if, for
all \(\component \not \in \components\), \(\mach[\component] = \nach[\component]\).

\definition Full states \((\mach,\pol,\prov,\context)\) and \((\nach,\pol,\prov,\context)\)
are also {\em \(\components\)-variants} if \(\mach\) and \(\nach\) are.

\definition An element set \(\components\) is safe in state \(\sigma)\),
written \(\components ~ \mathit{SAFE} ~ \sigma\), if for all
\(\sigma'\) such that \(\sigma \approx_{\components'} \sigma'\), if 
\(\sigma \hookrightarrow \obsT\) and
\(\sigma' \hookrightarrow \obsT'\), then
\(\obsT \eqsim \obsT'\).

\definition Let \(\Delta(\mach,\mach')\) be the set of elements \(\component\)
such that \(\mach[\component] \not = \mach'[\component]\).

\definition Let \(\sigma = (\mach,\pol,\prov,\context)\) and
\(\components = \{\component | \mathit{hd\_def} ~ \context ~ \component = \sealed\}\).
Let \(P\) be a predicate on states \(\sigma'\) that holds if
\(\Delta(\mach, \pi_m(\sigma')) \cap \components ~ \mathit{SAFE} ~ \sigma'\).
Then \(\sigma\) enjoys {\it return-time integrity} if \(\context \downarrow P\) holds.

\definition A system enjoys {\it stack integrity} if, for all reachable states \(\sigma\) such that
\(\sigma \stepstounder{\rho;\mathbf{Call}\dots} \sigma'\),
\(\sigma'\) enjoys return-time integrity.

\paragraph*{Caller Confidentiality}

Confidentiality properties are also modeled as non-interference, but with a twist:
the caller's confidential data should be kept secret from the callee, but after return,
will naturally be accessible to the caller once again. So, we must model confidentiality
in terms of events inside the callee. But confidentiality violations might not become
visible during the callee's lifetime -- the callee might read a secret and stash it somewhere
that it will be accessed later. So we must also consider the machine state at the end
of the call.

We could define a natural, strict form of confidentiality that requires that the final
states be identical. However, as with integrity, this is stricter than we need -- there
may be some conditions in which a secret is copied, but never used again. So, we once
again wish for our final condition to make the values {\it safe}. Which values?

\definition Let \(\mach,\mach'\) and \(\nach,\nach'\)
be pairs of machine states. Their {\em corrupted set}, written
\(\bar{\Diamond}(\mach,\mach',\nach,\nach')\), is the set of all elements
\(\component \in \Delta(\mach,\mach') \cup \Delta(\nach,\nach')\) such that
\(\mach'[\component] \not = \nach'[\component]\).

\definition Let \(\sigma = (\mach,\pol,\prov,\context)\) be a state and
\(\components = \{\component | \mathit{hd\_def} ~ \context ~ \component \in
\{\sealed, \unsealed\}\}\).

Then \(\sigma\) enjoys {\it caller confidentiality} if, for any \(\sigma'\)
that is a \(\components\)-variant of \(\sigma\), we can take
\(\context \uparrow \sigma \hookrightarrow \obsT\) and
\(\context \uparrow \sigma' \hookrightarrow \obsT'\) and have that
\(\obsT \simeq \obsT'\). And if, additionally, \(\sigma ~ (\context \Uparrow R) ~ \sigma'\),
where \(\sigma_1 ~ R ~ \sigma_2\) if
\(\bar{\Diamond}(\mach,\pi_m(\sigma_1),\pi_m(\sigma'),\pi_m(\sigma_2)) ~ \mathit{SAFE} ~ \sigma_1\).

\definition A system enjoys {\it universal caller confidentiality} if, for all reachable states
\(\sigma\) such that \(\sigma \stepstounder{\rho;\mathbf{Call}\dots} \sigma'\),
\(\sigma'\) enjoys caller confidentiality.
