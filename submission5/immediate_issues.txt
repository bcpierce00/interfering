Consistency issues
- page 3, snd disp, harpoon_C?
- observe figure is lost
- col 2 - mpc below line should be (m,p,ctx)
- eventual integrity -> return-time
- when R I doesn't read well
- transient -> irrelevant? dead?
- Fig. 2: stack needs to grow down
- Everywhere else, too
- Make context update partial?
- Def. 3: elements -> element
- K' -> K
- Def. 5: transient is on triples
- Def. 6: order of "with respect"
- Def. 7: initial states not defined
- |R
- Make transient -> ignore transient
- during_both is annoying
