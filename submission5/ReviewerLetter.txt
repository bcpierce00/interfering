This work is a resubmission from the CSF22 winter cycle, paper #75. We received a lot of good feedback that we tried to take into account for this cycle.

The biggest criticism by far was that we claimed a level of generality that was not supported by our testing. In this more recent draft, we have tried to avoid giving the implication that our properties are universal. They are inspired by the difficulty of specifying the lazy micro-policies of Roessler and DeHon, and we have dropped parts of our old formalism that were not aimed at filling that gap.

We have also include a new analysis of the relationship between our work and the StkTokens-Cerise family of work. Our previous comparison was very subjective. We compare ourselves to the latest paper, Georges et al., and focus on the features supported by their formalism vs. ours. Their work has drawn on ours for inspiration since the last submission, indicating that they found our ideas valuable.

Finally, we attempted to address to related concerns: the complexity and over-parameterization of our model, and the large gap between our extensions and our testing. We have dropped several extensions, but the ones that we do have are all tested, with the exception of memory-safe pointer passing. We judged this to be of sufficient importance to be worth including in a speculative state.

We thank the reviewers for their time, and hope that they find these changes to be an improvement.
