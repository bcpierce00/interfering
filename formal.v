(* APT: Since Components include registers, these aren't total orders, which is confusing. 
        Maybe we should get more honest about the makeup of Components?
        Or : just do these comparisons on Values; then we don't really need componentOf. *)
(* LEO: Components/Values: I agree that the abstraction we have right
now is iffy. There should be components (registers, pc, pointers) and
values (words). You can extract the value of a component given a
machine state (always I think?).  We also need to compare components
however: A contour is a map from components to labels, and during a
call we change that mapping depending on whether the component lies in
a particular position with respect to the SP.  We could have a
"withinRegion" function that only returns true if it is a valid
(stack) pointer with two other component-pointers. If we wanted to do
the ordering at the value level, then we would need a different
Component -> Value function "asValue", that reads of the "address" of
the component (and then this induces an ordering in components
itself). Not sure what the cleanest abstraction is here. *)

(* BCP: To me it seems cleaner to keep the distinction between
components and values.  Iâ€™ve been wondering whether we need to
explicitly recognize that there is a stack (i.e., whether we need,
say, an ordering on components). *)

(* APT: The Coq development currently has an ordering on components.
The problem is that it is total, so needs to be defined on registers
as well as stack addresses. 
A fairly simple way to fix this is just to make the order partial.   
A clearer way might be to do what is in the latex and define 
 Component = Addr + Register 
 Addr = Word 
 Value = Word 
and then just put an order on Word. *)

(* APT: Recast as operator over MTraces.
        Assumes each call sequence starts with the JAL, right? 
        Is this essential, or was it just to make things a bit simpler? *)
(* LEO: Each call sequence starts with a jal : that makes the
formalization significantly simpler as you can figure out the
information you need for contour changes the moment you start the
transition. Is it too unrealistic an assumption? *)
(* APT: I think this is fine, provided that we allow the callee to
access the piece of the callerâ€™s stack containing the arguments. To do
this, we can add an additional parameter to the call map entries
giving the number of args.  (Note that this prevents our handling
dynamic frame sizes, but that is a feature that is ok to omit at least
at first.)  *) 
(* LEO: Note that this way the handling of arguments/returns is not
part of the blessed sequence. And we could either (1) assume there is
enough local stack space for all calls or (2) handle stack allocation
and deallocation in the contours.  *)
