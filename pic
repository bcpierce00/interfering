Questions:
- Equality of observations enforces security.
- How does this enforce integrity?
- Why do we need the no-stuttering rule?
- If we went to the "state-description" based invariant of checking variance for M_i - M_i' and integrity for M_i - M_i+1, that is
a stronger property, but it guarantees more than just obs-trace interference.
- Is there an anti-observation trace abstraction we can use for integrity?
